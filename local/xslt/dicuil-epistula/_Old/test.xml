                  <head n="1.1">The text</head>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Epistula censuum</hi>(‘Letter of dues’) is a treatise on units of measurement, with a focus on homonyms and synonyms.
                     <note>The research conducted in this publication was funded by the Irish Research Council under award number GOIPD/2023/1371 as part of the Government of Ireland 2023 Postdoctoral Fellowship ‘Dicuil - an Irish and Carolingian Universalist and his Intellectual Legacy (DICUIL)’</note> It was written by the Irish scholar Dicuil, who also authored several other scientific, geographical, and grammatical texts on the continent in the first quarter of the ninth century. His ‘Epistula censuum’ can be dated to 818 CE, probably in or around March, by Dicuil's reference to the end of the twice four hundredth and twice ninth year of the conception of the Lord right at the beginning of the main text (for annunciation dating, see Dicuil's comments in ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’, III iiii).<note>Dicuil, De cursu solis lunaeque: Translation and commentary, ed. and trans. C. G. Schweizer (PhD thesis, Trinity College Dublin, 2023), pp 209-10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Right after this, Dicuil speaks of the duty to bring tribute to the king, which implies that the text is a further annual gift for Louis the Pious: Dicuil had highlighted clearly that the first two books of ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’ were such gifts in 814 and 815, and he had again addressed the ‘king’ in Book IIII (816).<note>Dicuil, De cursu solis lunaeque: Translation and commentary, ed. and trans. C. G. Schweizer (PhD thesis, Trinity College Dublin, 2023), pp 29-34 (I vi); 49-56 (I viii); 127-28 (II xiii); 237-38 (IIII iiii).</note> This, along with the thematical proximity, renders the ‘Epistula censuum’ some kind of sequel to ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’. However, the new title, both in the table of contents and the text, shows that it is more than simply a Book VI of ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’, or even an appendix to it (as suggested by Cordoliani 1960 and rightly rejected by Pabst 1994; see Schweizer 2022). While units of measurement were also discussed in computistical treatises of the time, Dicuil himself notes that the topic is ‘not unrelated to grammar’ – a point that is validated by his reliance on Priscian as a primary source and his focus on homonyms and synonyms.</p>

                  <head n="1.2">The manuscripts</head>
                  <p>There is one known extant manuscript of the ‘Epistula censuum’, <ref target="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10032215p">Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS NAL 1645 (Libri 88), ff 7v-14v (from here: P)</ref>. P consists of two gatherings, which were removed from <ref target="https://arca.irht.cnrs.fr/ark:/63955/md89d504ss9j">Tours, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 803 ii (T)</ref>) by Guglielmo Libri in the 1840s. In this witness, the ‘Epistula censuum’ is preceded by Dicuil's ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’ (T, ff 58v-103v, and P, ff 1r-7v). At the beginning of this text, there is a table of contents for both of these texts, plus Dicuil's ‘De prima syllaba’ (825), which is not extant in these two manuscripts. Presumably, it never was included, as f. 14v of P contains considerable blank space below the end of the ‘Epistula censuum’. This table of contents enabled André van de Vyver to discover the ending of ‘De cursu solis lunaeque’ and the ‘Epistula censuum’ in P.</p>

                  <p>T was dated to the tenth, P even to the 11th century, until E. K. Rand suggested the end of the ninth and Bischoff even the second quarter or middle of the ninth century; since then, the ninth century is generally accepted. Rand implies Tours as the place of origin, Bischoff only (not southern) France; Godden, Jayatilaka, and Love criticise Rand's suggestion (Delisle 1888, pp 78-9, no. XLVIII; Dorange 1875, pp 375-6; Collon 1900, pp 604-5; Rand 1929, pp 192-3, no. 191; Bischoff 2014, p. 244, after no. 5110 and p. 368, nos 6141-2; Troncarelli 1987, pp 194-5, no. 51; Love 2012, p. 94; <ref target="http://www.mirabileweb.it/manuscript/tours-bibliothèque-municipale-803-manoscript/131845">Mirabile</ref>; Godden, Jayatilaka, Love 2024, pp ccxxix-ccxxxi, esp. p. ccxxix, n. 451).</p>               

                  <p>The folios measure circa 285×195 mm. P was rebound in modern times, with paper covering some small parts of the text. In situ, these parts can still be read under the right light conditions. A detailed description and analysis of T and P can be found in my thesis (Dicuil, De cursu, ed. Schweizer 2023, pp LIX-LXXIII) and will be published elsewhere.</p>
