<h1 class="fw-light mb-5">About Armarium</h1>

<p>In ancient and medieval times, book collections were often small. 
	They could be stored in an <i>armarium</i>, i.e. a cabinet standing upright against a wall, 
	or perhaps in a <i>theca</i> (or <i>bibliotheca</i>), typically a chest on the floor.
	The Latin word <i>armarium</i> must have originally applied to a store for weapons. 
	It was more commonly used, however, to describe a cabinet or cupboard in general 
	(cf. French <i>armoire</i>, etc.), including a book-case.
</p>

<p>The image below, from the <a href="https://www.ravennamosaici.it/en/mausoleum-of-galla-placidia/">mausoleum of Galla Placidia</a>
	in Ravenna (c. AD 425–450) depicts a Late Antique <i>armarium</i> on the left, with shelves and doors, 
	containing the four Gospels. It is similar to the famous depiction of the 
	<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Codex_Amiatinus#/media/File:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg">scribe Ezra writing beside an <i>armarium</i></a> 
	in the eighth-century Codex Amiatinus.
</p>

<p>This <b>digital Armarium</b> is also a repository for texts. It aims to faciliate
	scholars who wish to publish scholarly digital editions, especially of short to medium length. 
	Its principles of simple technical implementation, 
	long-term preservation, citability, readability, and quality assurance are explained further 
	<a href="#principles">below</a>.

<h2 id="principles" class="fw-light mt-5 mb-5">Design principles</h2>

<h2 id="simple-implementation" class="h3 mt-4 fw-light">1. Simple technical implementation</h2>
<p>The primary goal of Armarium is to make it as simple as possible for researchers to publish their editions online.
To that end, the technical barrier is kept as low as possible.
</p>

<p>Content should be supplied in XML, a format that is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pmoran.ie/posts/guide-to-xml/">very easy to learn</a>. 
	More specifically, the XML should conform to the recommendations of the <a target="_blank" href="https://tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI).
	You do <i>not</i> need to study the vast TEI guidelines, however. You can just use the XML templates and short documentation 
	provided here (to follow).
</p>

<p>The same principle of simplicity also supports <a href="#long-term-preservation">long-term preservation</a> and 
	<a href="#readability">readability</a> (see below).
</p>
	
<p>Simplicity does not need to be a limitation. The data behind all of editions will be freely 
	available to be processed and analysed in more complex applications.
</p>

<h2 id="long-term-preservation" class="h3 mt-5 fw-light">2. Long-term preservation</h2>
<p>The core of this resource is the XML data underlying each edition. XML is an excellent format
	for long-term archiving. This data will be deposited and made publicly accessible in long-term data repositories 
	(GitHub and Zenodo) to ensure access for future generations.
</p>

<p>The technology running the website (HTML, CSS and some 
	very light PHP scripts) is also chosen to be as simple as possible, 
	in order to minimise requirements for updating and maintenance.
	This will support the long-term stability of the web resource.	
</p>

<h2 id="citability" class="h3 mt-5 fw-light">3. Citability</h2>
<p>Editors deserve full and clear recognition for their work. 
	Each edition is presented with a recommended citation formula at the head of every page.
	This will include a unique <a target="_blank" href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOI</a> as well as
	a simple, human-readable URL (web address). 
</p>

<h2 id="readability" class="h3 mt-5 fw-light">4. Readability</h2>
<p>The primary function of any edition is to be read. 
	Armarium aims to present text in a simple, uncluttered and accessible format, with
	attention to typographical detail (on both desktop and mobile screens).
	Graphical content, user-interface elements and colours are kept minimal, to support
	restful reading and concentration.
</p>

<h2 id="quality-assurance" class="h3 mt-5 fw-light">5. Quality assurance</h2>
<p>Armarium will have an editorial board to review submissions and ensure the overall quality of the collection.
	Editors may also choose to avail of a more formal anonymous peer-review process (and claim peer-review status accordingly).
</p>

<h2 id="technical" class="fw-light pt-5 mt-5 mb-5">Credits and technical information</h2>
